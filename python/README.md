# name-normalizer â€“ Python version

Open both `name_normalizer.py` and `name_normalizer_test.py` file in your favorite editor.

The `normalize` function's skeleton is placed at the top of `name_normalizaer.py` and needs to be implemented. The corresponding tests are placed in `name_normalizer_test.py`. The tests are disabled by the `@unittest.skip` attribute.

To enable a test, just delete the `@unittest.skip` attribute of the corresponding test. Now the enabled test will check your implementation when executed.

To run the tests, open up a terminal, `cd` into the Python project (this directory) and run `python name_normalizer_test`.

Now `python` will run all enabled tests and print the test results on your screen.
